1. To compile the parser you have to install flex and bison
   (make sure to not install them to C:Program (x86) as bison is not able to recognize whitespaces in directorynames)
2. Open CMD / Terminal
3. Go to the directory where your files are stored
4. execute the following commands (Feel free to use bat):
    - flex pl0Scanner.l
    - bison -dy Pl0Compiler.y
    - gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o compiler.exe
